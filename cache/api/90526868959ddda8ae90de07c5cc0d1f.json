He has repeatedly suggested that he deserves to win this year\u2019s prize and has claimed it would be a \u201cbig insult\u201d to America if he does not win.\n\nSo who are the five members of the Nobel Committee making this year\u2019s crucial decision?\n\nWho are the five Nobel Peace Prize judges?\n\nThe Nobel Committee was established by the Norwegian Storting (Norway\u2019s Parliament) in 1897 and is tasked with picking the laureates of the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe members of the committee are elected for a period of six years and can be re-elected.\n\nAccording to the Nobel Peace Prize\u2019s rules, members of the committee represent the strength of the different political parties in Norway\u2019s Parliament, but cannot be sitting members of the parliament. Once elected, the committee picks its own chairman and deputy chairman, and the director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute serves as the committee\u2019s secretary.\n\nThis year\u2019s Nobel Committee members are:\n\nJorgen Watne Frydnes\n\nFrydnes is the chair of the Nobel Committee.\n\nAt 41, he is the youngest-ever chair of the committee. He was appointed in 2021 and will remain a member until 2026.\n\nFrydnes has spent his career working as a human rights advocate. He has also served as secretary-general of PEN Norway, a group that promotes freedom of expression.\n\nHe has worked with the nongovernment organisation (NGO), Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders, or MSF), and is a member of the human rights NGO, Norwegian Helsinki Committee.\n\nWhile Frydnes is officially nonpolitical, he is known to be supportive of Norway\u2019s ruling Labour Party. He managed a memorial to the 69 Labour activist victims of the 2011 Utoeya massacre carried out by a Norwegian right-wing extremist. Frydnes has played an important role in rebuilding the island of Utoeya since then.\n\nAsle Toje\n\nAged 51, Toje is the vice chair of the Nobel Committee. He has been a member since 2018 and was reappointed to the committee for the period of 2024-2029.\n\nHe is considered a conservative and served as research director at the Norwegian Nobel Institute before joining the Nobel Committee. He has also published a book called The European Union as a Small Power: After the Post-Cold War.\n\nAnne Enger\n\nEnger, 75, has been a member of the committee since 2018 and has also been reappointed for the period from 2021 to 2026.\n\nShe studied nursing and began her career teaching the subject. She later switched to politics, supporting Norway\u2019s Centre Party.\n\nEnger served as chief of the Ministry of Culture and deputy to the prime minister of Norway between 1997 and 1999, acting prime minister in 1998 and became acting chief of the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy briefly in 1999. She has been county governor of the region of Ostfold since 2004.\n\nEnger has also headed the secretariat of the People\u2019s Movement against Free Abortion in Norway.\n\nKristin Clemet\n\nClemet, 68, was appointed to the committee in 2021 and will be a member till 2026.\n\nShe is a Norwegian politician for Hoyre, Norway\u2019s Conservative Party.\n\nAn economist by profession, she was twice an adviser to Norway\u2019s past prime minister, Kare Willoch of the Conservative Party, and has served as minister of education between 2001 and 2005.\n\nGry Larsen\n\nLarsen, 49, is a former Labour state secretary in the Foreign Ministry and head of Norwegian humanitarian organisation CARE Norway, which advocates for global women\u2019s rights. She has previously criticised Trump\u2019s cuts to foreign aid spending.\n\nShe was appointed to the committee for the period of 2024-2029.\n\nHow have they voted in the past?\n\nAccording to the rules of the Nobel Peace Prize, the Nobel Committee receives nominations from members of governments around the world, or the International Court of Justice in The Hague and university professors of of history, social sciences, law, philosophy, theology and religion, among others, by the end of January but are not permitted to reveal the names of the nominees until a winner is announced. In March, the committee prepares a short-list of candidates and announces the winner in October.\n\nThe selection process takes place in complete secrecy. Information on how individual members vote is also not revealed.\n\n\u201cWe discuss, we argue, there is a high temperature,\u201d Frydnes, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, told the BBC, which got access to the final meeting of the committee this year.\n\n\u201cBut also, of course, we are civilised, and we try to make a consensus-based decision every year,\u201d he added.\n\nSince Frydnes became chair of the committee in the group has given the Nobel Peace Prize to Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov in 2021 for their efforts to safeguard freedom of expression; Belarusian dissident Ales Bialiatski in 2022 for protecting fundamental rights, and Iran\u2019s Narges Mohammadi in 2023 for fighting for women\u2019s rights.\n\nLast year, Frydnes and the committee announced Japan\u2019s Nihon Hidankyo, a group of survivors of the 1945 US bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as the winner of the Peace Prize.\n\n\u201cI grew up after the end of the Cold War, when democracy seemed unstoppable and nuclear disarmament realistic,\u201d Frydnes said when he presented the award.\n\nHave any of the members been involved in any controversy?\n\nToje and Enger were also on the committee when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed won the Prize in 2019 for his role in ending the 20-year military stalemate between Ethiopia and Eritrea. After Ahmed\u2019s win, Ethiopia unleashed a new offensive in Tigray in 2020.\n\n\u201cThere are always some people who feel that this laureate was the wrong one,\u201d Toje had said at an event hosted by the International Peace Institute (IPI) that same year.\n\n\u201cOnce the announcement has been made, we realise it lives its own life \u2026 if the Nobel Peace Prize didn\u2019t spark outrage and strong emotions, well, we wouldn\u2019t be living up to our reputation,\u201d he added.\n\nIn 2023, Indian media also reported that Toje had endorsed India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, for the Nobel Peace Prize. But BOOM, a fact-checking news organisation in the country, found that it was a false claim and that Toje had never made any such statement.\n\nBack in 1994, Enger had voted against Norway\u2019s European Union membership. In her view, joining the EU would result in Norway losing its traditions and democracy. Enger has also championed anti-abortion campaigns but has been unsuccessful in reversing Norway\u2019s abortion rights.\n\nMeanwhile, Larsen has faced criticism from the Norwegian Israel Centre Against Anti-Semitism (NIS). In 2006, the institute wrote a letter to the former Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere, accusing Larsen, his political adviser at the time, of demanding \u201ca full boycott of Israel\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe was appointed as political adviser despite her being responsible for anti-Israel activities,\u201d the letter had said. It is not clear if Larsen responded to this claim.\n\nWhat do they think of Trump?\n\nTrump has been desperate to win the prize ever since US President Barack Obama won it in 2009.\n\nBesides reiterating that he deserves this year\u2019s prize since he has resolved at least \u201cseven wars\u201d (now eight wars with the Gaza peace deal announced on Thursday), the US president has also called Norwegian diplomats, including former NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, who is the country\u2019s current finance minister, to lobby them for the Prize.\n\nBut Frydnes says the committee doesn\u2019t give in to such pressure, and a decision is always made independently.\n\n\u201cEvery year, we receive thousands of letters, emails, requests, people saying \u2018this is the one you should choose\u2019 \u2013 so to have that campaign, the pressure \u2026 isn\u2019t really something new,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\nFrydnes did not openly refer to Trump in the interview, but in the past, he has called out the US president for cracking down on \u201cdemocratic nations\u201d.\n\nAnne Enger has remained entirely tight-lipped about her preferences for the Nobel Peace Prize, while Larsen has criticised Trump for cutting USAID and also for how he talks about women and human rights.\n\nClemet is also a Trump sceptic. \u201cAfter just over 100 days as president, [Trump] is well underway in dismantling American democracy, and he is doing everything he can to tear down the liberal and rules-based world order,\u201d she wrote in May.\n\nToje, on the other hand, attended Trump\u2019s presidential inauguration earlier this year and called it a \u201cf****** great party\u201d. He has also said that Western liberals should take a more \u201cnuanced\u201d approach to him and the MAGA political movement.\n\nHowever, there is no indication of whether he could support Trump for the prize. He has also brushed off any sort of influence from lobbying.\n\n\u201cThese types of influence campaigns have a rather more negative effect than a positive one, because we talk about it on the committee. Some candidates push for it really hard, and we do not like it,\u201d he told The National newspaper.\n\n\u201cWe are used to work[ing] in a locked room without being attempted to be influenced,\u201d he added.\n\nHas this been a particularly tough year for Norway\u2019s Nobel Committee?\n\nAmid ongoing wars and democratic repression in some countries, as well as Trump\u2019s pressure to be awarded the prize, Frydnes told the BBC that he and the other members feel that \u201cthe world is listening, and the world is discussing, and discussing how we can achieve peace is a good thing\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd we have to stay strong and principled in our choices \u2026 that\u2019s our job.\u201d\n\nWithin Norway, however, worries have arisen about what the US president might do if he does not win the prize.\n\nThe US has already imposed 15 percent tariffs on the country\u2019s exports.\n\nThe Trump administration also told CNBC last month that the US was \u201cvery troubled\u201d after Norway \u2013 which has an approximately $2 trillion sovereign fund \u2013 announced it would divest from US company Caterpillar because of its links to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza.\n\nBut in an interview with Bloomberg on October 3, Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said Norway\u2019s government was not involved in the Nobel Peace Prize decisions.\n\nWho are the other contenders?\n\nThe Nobel Committee has received 338 nominees for the prize, out of which 244 are individuals and 94 are organisations.\n\nBut according to the rules of the Nobel Peace Prize, the \u201ccommittee does not confirm the names of nominees, neither to the media nor to the candidates themselves. There are cases where names of candidates appear in the media, either as a result of sheer speculation or because individuals themselves report to have nominated specific candidates\u201d.\n\nSudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms, a volunteer group helping civilians in the war-torn country, and Yulia Navalnaya, the wife of Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny, who died last year in a Russian prison, are seen as potential contenders.\n\nAccording to bookies like Ladbrokes and oddsmakers, Trump and the Sudanese group are favourites.\n\nAmid speculation, Nina Graeger, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, told Al Jazeera that according to tradition, every year she comes up with a list of five potential candidates.\n\n\u201cMy list this year includes Sudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms, who are local Sudanese organisers who provide humanitarian support to committees affected by the war in the country. These voluntary groups have set up communal kitchens, supported evacuations, offered medical care, fixed infrastructure and provided other services to communities,\u201d she said.\n\nShe noted that awarding this year\u2019s Peace Prize to a deserving humanitarian initiative such as the Emergency Response Rooms would \u201chighlight the critical importance of access to lifesaving aid in times of conflict, and the power of everyday citizens to serve humanity in difficult times\u201d.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists is also a worthy potential recipient of the Peace Prize, she said.\n\n\u201cAt a time when the free press is under historic assault, awarding the Committee to Protect Journalists the Nobel Peace Prize would send a powerful message that peace and democracy are endangered if journalists are prevented from keeping the world informed, including from behind the front lines,\u201d she added.", "authors": ["Priyanka Shankar"], "published_date": "2025-10-10T00:00:00", "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2023-10-06T082552Z_1294653203_RC2WM3AK2C3C_RTRMADP_3_NOBEL-PRIZE-PEACE-1760004585.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440", "summary": "Who are the five Nobel Peace Prize judges?\nThe Nobel Committee was established by the Norwegian Storting (Norway\u2019s Parliament) in 1897 and is tasked with picking the laureates of the Nobel Peace Prize.\nThis year\u2019s Nobel Committee members are: Jorgen Watne Frydnes Frydnes is the chair of the Nobel Committee.\nHe is considered a conservative and served as research director at the Norwegian Nobel Institute before joining the Nobel Committee.\nIn 2023, Indian media also reported that Toje had endorsed India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, for the Nobel Peace Prize.", "keywords": ["judges", "deciding", "nobel", "prize", "peace", "trump", "committee", "norway\u2019s", "frydnes", "members", "norwegian", "minister", "year\u2019s", "enger", "president", "list", "rights", "norway", "toje", "winner", "win", "institute", "world", "larsen", "candidates", "told", "trump\u2019s", "announced", "member", "group", "party", "prime", "parliament", "wars", "period"], "success": true, "error": null}}
