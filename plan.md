## **4. Workflow – Step by Step**

### **Step 1: User Input**

* Terminal prompt: user enters a **headline or article**.
* Input stored as a string for processing.

---

### **Step 2: Offline NLP Preprocessing**

* Clean text:

  * Remove URLs, punctuation, HTML tags.
  * Lowercase, remove stopwords.
* Tokenize & lemmatize using **NLTK or spaCy**.
* Optional: extract **keywords, named entities, sentiment**.

---

### **Step 3: Offline ML Classification**

* Load **trained ML model and TF-IDF vectorizer**.
* Transform user input into **feature vector**.
* Predict **fake/real probability**:

  * `ml_prob_fake` (0–1)
* Display **top contributing TF-IDF features** for transparency.
* Output: **ML-based verdict**.

---

### **Step 4: Real-Time NewsAPI Verification**

* Query **NewsAPI** for articles related to user input.
* Fetch top **3–5 articles** from Indian and global sources.
* For each article:

  * Compute **TF-IDF cosine similarity** or **sentence embeddings similarity** with user input.
* Generate **similarity score**:

  ```
  similarity_score = max(similarity with top articles)
  ```
* Display supporting articles and links.

---

### **Step 5: Optional Fact-Checking Scraping**

* Scrape **Alt News or BoomLive** for claims matching user input.
* If a claim is found:

  * Assign `+1` for real, `-1` for fake, `0` if not found.
* Rate-limit and cache queries for speed.
* Display verdict and URL.

---

### **Step 6: Optional Google Fact Check API Verification**

* Query API for the user claim.
* If claim is found:

  * Extract textual verdict (`True/False/Misleading`) and publisher.
* Assign numeric score:

  * True → +1, False → -1, Misleading → 0
* Display fact-check results and URLs.

---

### **Step 7: Combine Scores for Final Verdict**

* Compute **real-time verification score**:

  ```
  final_fact_score = w1*newsapi_score + w2*scrape_score + w3*google_score
  ```

  * Example weights: `w1=0.3, w2=0.3, w3=0.4`
* Combine with **offline ML probability**:

  ```
  final_score = alpha*ml_prob_fake + (1-alpha)*(1 - final_fact_score)
  ```

  * Example: `alpha=0.7` → ML has higher influence
* Map final score to verdict:

  * > 0.5 → Likely Fake
  * ≤0.5 → Likely Real

---

### **Step 8: Terminal Output**

* Display:

  1. **User input**
  2. **Offline ML probability + top features**
  3. **NewsAPI similarity + supporting articles**
  4. **Alt News / Google Fact Check verdicts (if available)**
  5. **Combined final score and verdict**

* Optional: display analytics metrics (precision, recall, TF-IDF top words, cosine similarity values).

### this is the final current plan

Revised Workflow and Implementation Plan

Comprehensive Workflow with ML Classifier Integration

User Interaction Flow

1.

Input Collection:

User runs the modified phase1_implementation.py script

User is prompted to enter text directly in the terminal

User can paste either a short claim or a full article

2.

Automatic Input Classification:

System automatically detects whether the input is a claim or an article

Classification is based on text length, structure, and complexity

3.

Multi-layered Verification Process:

For Claims:

ML Classification: Input is processed through the trained ML classifier

NewsAPI Verification: System searches for relevant articles using NewsAPI

Combined Analysis: Results from both ML and NewsAPI are weighted and combined

Final verdict determined based on combined evidence strength

For Articles:

ML Classification: Full article is processed through the ML classifier

Key Claim Extraction: System extracts key claims from the article text

Individual Claim Verification: Each claim verified using both ML and NewsAPI

Aggregation: Results combined to determine overall article credibility

4.

Results Presentation:

System displays a comprehensive verification report

Results include ML confidence score, NewsAPI evidence, and combined verdict

Color-coded output highlights true/false determinations

For articles, breakdown of individual claim verification is provided

Detailed Implementation Plan

1. Input Handling Modifications

Add a new function get_user_input() to phase1_implementation.py that will:

Accept input directly from the terminal using input() function

Allow users to paste either a short claim or a full article text

Return the raw input text for further processing

2. Input Type Detection

Create a detect_input_type() function that will:

Analyze text length (>150 words likely an article)

Check for structural elements (paragraphs, headlines)

Return "claim" or "article" classification

3. ML Classifier Integration

Modify the existing ML classifier usage to:

Load the pre-trained model from models/classifier.pkl

Load the vectorizer from models/tfidf_vectorizer.pkl

Process both claims and articles through the classifier

For articles, also process extracted claims individually

Return confidence scores for fake/real classification

4. NewsAPI Integration

For claims:

Use existing verify_claim_with_newsapi() method

Search for relevant articles using NewsAPI

Calculate similarity and contradiction scores

For articles:

Extract key claims using NLP techniques (sentence importance)

Verify each extracted claim using NewsAPI

Aggregate results across all claims

5. Combined Scoring System

Implement a weighted scoring system that:

Combines ML classifier score (50%)

NewsAPI verification results (30%)

Similarity calculation results (20%)

Produces a final credibility score between 0-1

6. Claim Extraction from Articles

Implement a function to extract key claims from articles:

Use sentence importance scoring

Identify sentences that make factual assertions

Extract 3-5 key claims for individual verification

7. Output Formatting

Create a format_verification_results() function that:

Displays different output formats based on input type

Shows ML classification confidence

Lists supporting/contradicting articles from NewsAPI

For articles, shows breakdown of key claims and their verification

Uses color coding for better readability

8. Modifications to test_end_to_end()

Update the function to:

Accept the input type parameter

Process input differently based on type

Call appropriate verification workflows

Use the combined scoring system

Format and display comprehensive results

9. Error Handling

Add robust error handling for:

API failures

ML model loading issues

Text processing errors

Empty or invalid inputs

This implementation plan integrates all components of the fake news detection system (ML classifier, NewsAPI, similarity calculation) into a unified workflow that can handle both claims and full articles, providing a comprehensive verification solution.

Backend Builder

I'll analyze the project files and folders to understand their purpose and implementation. Let me scan the project structure first to get a comprehensive view.

Fake News Detection

I'll examine the project plan and analyze the key files to understand their implementation and purpose.

plan.md 1 - 100

Based on my analysis of the project structure, I can see that this is a Fake News Detection system with multiple components. Let me provide a concise overview of the project files and their purposes:

## Project Structure Analysis

### Core Components:

1. 1.

ML Classification System

- models/classifier.pkl and models/tfidf_vectorizer.pkl : Trained machine learning model and vectorizer

- src/train_model.py : Training script for the ML classifier

- src/preprocess.py : Text preprocessing utilities

2. 2.

NewsAPI Integration

- src/newsapi_verifier.py : Handles interactions with NewsAPI

- cache/api/ : Stores cached API responses

- test_newsapi.py : Tests for NewsAPI functionality

3. 3.

Article Processing

- src/article_scraper.py : Scrapes and processes articles

- src/similarity_calculator.py : Calculates similarity between texts

- test_article_scraper.py : Tests for article scraping

4. 4.

Integration Components

- src/integrated_verifier.py : Combines multiple verification methods

- src/fact_checker.py : Main fact-checking logic

- phase1_implementation.py : Current implementation of the system

5. 5.

Testing & Evaluation

- Various test files ( test_*.py ): Unit and integration tests

- test_trump_claim.py : Specific test for a sample claim

6. 6.

Data Management

- src/dataset_handler.py : Handles dataset operations

- data/ : Stores datasets and processed data

- FakeNewsNet-master/ : External dataset

The project follows a modular architecture with separate components for:

- ML-based classification

- NewsAPI verification

- Article scraping and similarity calculation

- Integrated verification combining multiple approaches

The current implementation in phase1_implementation.py includes:

- Environment setup

- Dataset processing

- ML model training

- NewsAPI integration testing

- Similarity calculation testing

- Weighted scoring system

- End-to-end testing

The system is designed to verify claims using multiple methods and combine their results for a final verdict, but currently lacks a comprehensive user interface for direct input of claims or articles.

## End-to-End Workflow

The system follows this workflow:

1. 1.

Input Processing - Accepts a claim or article text

2. 2.

Multi-Method Verification :

- ML model classifies the text (40% weight)

- NewsAPI finds related articles for cross-verification (25% weight)

- Similarity calculation compares claim with article content (15% weight)

- Google Fact Check API searches for professional fact checks (20% weight)

3. 3.

Combined Scoring - Weighted average of all verification methods

4. 4.

Result Presentation - Final verdict with confidence score and supporting evidence

The FactChecker class in fact_checker.py orchestrates this process, combining all verification methods into a single, comprehensive result.

This hybrid approach provides more robust verification than any single method alone, making it effective for detecting various types of fake news.
