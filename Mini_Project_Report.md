## 3. Problem Statement

### Core Problem
The proliferation of misinformation and fake news across digital platforms poses a significant threat to informed decision-making and democratic processes. Traditional fact-checking methods are often slow, manual, and cannot keep pace with the rapid spread of false information online.

### Challenges Addressed
1. **Speed vs. Accuracy Trade-off**: Balancing the need for rapid detection with maintaining high accuracy
2. **Multi-Source Verification**: Integrating multiple verification methods to reduce false positives/negatives
3. **Real-time Processing**: Providing immediate feedback on news claims while maintaining reliability
4. **Scalability**: Handling various types of text input (claims, articles, URLs) efficiently
5. **Context Understanding**: Analyzing semantic similarity and content relevance beyond keyword matching

### Requirements
- **Offline Capability**: Function without constant internet connectivity using pre-trained ML models
- **Real-time Verification**: Cross-reference claims with current news sources via APIs
- **Multi-modal Analysis**: Combine ML classification, similarity scoring, and external verification
- **User-friendly Interface**: Terminal-based application with clear, colored output
- **Caching System**: Optimize performance through intelligent caching of API responses
- **Configurable Weights**: Allow users to adjust the importance of different verification methods

### Background Information
The system addresses the growing need for automated fact-checking tools that can assist journalists, researchers, and general users in quickly assessing the credibility of news content. By combining multiple verification approaches, the system provides a more robust and reliable assessment than single-method solutions.

### Algorithm Implementation

#### 1. Machine Learning Classification Algorithm

**Logistic Regression with TF-IDF Vectorization**

Mathematical formulation:
```
P(y=1|x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))
where z = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ
```

**TF-IDF Feature Extraction:**
```
TF-IDF(t,d) = TF(t,d) × IDF(t)
TF(t,d) = (Number of times term t appears in document d) / (Total number of terms in document d)
IDF(t) = log(Total number of documents / Number of documents containing term t)
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **Class Weight Balancing**: `class_weight='balanced'` to handle imbalanced datasets
- **SMOTE Integration**: Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique for dataset balancing
- **Text Preprocessing**: Comprehensive cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization
- **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF vectorization with optimized parameters

#### 2. Similarity Calculation Algorithm

**Cosine Similarity with TF-IDF Vectors:**
```
similarity(A,B) = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
where A and B are TF-IDF vectors
```

**Semantic Similarity with Sentence Transformers:**
```
semantic_similarity = cosine_similarity(embedding_A, embedding_B)
```

**Combined Similarity Score:**
```
final_similarity = α × tfidf_similarity + β × semantic_similarity + γ × source_credibility
where α + β + γ = 1
```

#### 3. Weighted Scoring Algorithm

**Final Confidence Score Calculation:**
```
Final_Score = (w_ml × ML_Score + w_news × NewsAPI_Score + w_sim × Similarity_Score) / (w_ml + w_news + w_sim)

where:
- w_ml, w_news, w_sim are configurable weights (default: 0.4, 0.3, 0.3)
- Each score is normalized to [0, 1] range
```
