Climate finance is important for our survival,\u201d Talia said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about building [over the] next two or three years to come, but right now, and we need it now, in order for us to respond to the climate crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nTalia, who is also Tuvalu\u2019s minister of home affairs and the environment, said the issue of financing will be a key issue at the upcoming UN COP30 climate meeting in Belem, in the Brazilian Amazon, in November.\n\n\u2018You pollute, you pay\u2019\n\nTuvalu is one of many countries already pushing for a better deal on climate financing at this year\u2019s COP, after many advocates left last year\u2019s meeting in Azerbaijan disappointed by the unambitious $300bn target set by richer countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDescribing the COP climate meeting as having become more like a \u201cfestival for the oil-producing countries\u201d, Talia said Tuvalu is also exploring a range of alternative initiatives, from a push to create the world\u2019s first fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty to seeking to add its entire cultural heritage to the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nRepresentatives of oil-producing countries are now attending the COP climate meetings in \u201cbig numbers\u201d, Talia said, in order to try and \u201creally bury our voice as small developing countries\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey take control of the narrative. They take control of the process. They try to water down all the texts. They try to put a stop to climate finance,\u201d Talia said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time that we should call out to the world that finance is important for us to survive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe polluter pay principle is still there. You pollute, you pay,\u201d he added.\n\nTalia also said that it was frustrating to see his own country struggling to survive, while other countries continue to spend billions of dollars on weapons for current and future wars.\n\n\u201cWhilst your country is facing this existential threat, it\u2019s quite disappointing to see that the world is investing billions and trillions of dollars in wars, in conflicts,\u201d he said.\n\nA report released this week by the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) found that 39 small island countries, which are home to some 65 million people, already need about $12bn a year to help them cope with the effects of climate change.\n\nThat figure is many times more than the roughly $2bn a year they are collectively receiving now, and which represents just 0.2 percent of the amount spent on global climate finance worldwide.\n\nGCA, a Rotterdam-based nonprofit organisation, also found that island states are already experiencing an average $1.7bn in annual economic losses due to climate change.\n\nTuvalu is not only focused on its own survival \u2013 the island state is considered to be facing one of the most severe existential threats from rising sea levels \u2013 it is also continuing to find ways to fight climate change globally.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Tuvalu is leading the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty,\u201d Talia said.\n\nAbout 16 countries have now signed on to the treaty, with Colombia offering to host the first international conference for the phase-out of fossil fuels next year.\n\n\u201cWe see its relevance for us,\u201d Talia said of the treaty.\n\n\u201cWe want to grow in number in order for us to come up with a treaty, apart from the Paris Agreement,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018We need to hold the industrialised countries accountable\u2019\n\nEven as Tuvalu, a country with a population of less than 10,000 people, is fighting for immediate action on climate change, it is also making preparations for its own uncertain future, including creating a digital repository of its culture so that nothing is lost to the sea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalia, who is also Tuvalu\u2019s minister for culture, said that he made the formal preliminary submission to UNESCO two weeks before the UNGA meeting for \u201cthe whole of Tuvalu to be listed\u201d on the World Heritage List.\n\n\u201cIf we are to disappear, which is something that we don\u2019t want to anticipate, but if worst comes to worst, at least you know our values, our culture, heritage, are well secured,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\n\nLikewise, Talia said his country doesn\u2019t see its 2023 cooperation pact with Australia, which also includes the world\u2019s first climate change migration visa, as an indication that the island\u2019s future is sealed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t look at the Falepili Agreement as a way of escaping the issue of climate change, but rather a pathway,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA pathway that we will allow our people in Tuvalu to get good education, trained, and then return home,\u201d he said, referring to the agreement giving some Tuvaluans access to education, healthcare and unlimited travel to Australia.\n\nThe agreement text includes an acknowledgement from both parties that \u201cthe statehood and sovereignty of Tuvalu will continue, and the rights and duties inherent thereto will be maintained, notwithstanding the impact of climate change-related sea level rise\u201d.\n\nTalia also said that a recent ruling from the UN\u2019s top court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, declared that states have a responsibility to address climate change by cooperating to cut emissions, following through on climate agreements, and protecting vulnerable populations and ecosystems from harm.\n\nThe ICJ ruling \u201creally changed the whole context of climate change debates\u201d, Talia said.\n\n\u201cThe highest court has spoken, the highest court has delivered the judgement,\u201d he said of the case, which was brought before the ICJ by Tuvalu\u2019s neighbour Vanuatu.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s just a matter of, how are we going to live that, or weave that, into our climate policies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to hold the industrialised countries accountable to their actions,\u201d he added.", "authors": ["Lyndal Rowlands"], "published_date": "2025-10-10T00:00:00",
