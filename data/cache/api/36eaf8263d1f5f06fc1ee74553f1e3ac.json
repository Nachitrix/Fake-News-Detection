In each case, he has done so despite staunch opposition from mayors and governors from the Democratic Party, who say Trump\u2019s claims of lawlessness and violence do not reflect reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA federal judge in September said the Republican-led administration \u201cwillfully\u201d broke federal law by putting Guard troops in Los Angeles over protests about immigration raids.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said the president\u2019s strategy is \u201cunconstitutional, it\u2019s illegal and it\u2019s dangerous\u201d.\n\nIllinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration on Monday, seeking to block orders to federalise 300 Illinois Guard troops and send Texas Guard troops to Chicago. During a hearing, US Justice Department lawyers told a federal judge that Texas Guard troops were already in transit to Illinois.\n\nThe judge, April Perry, permitted the deployment to proceed for now, but ordered the US government to file a response by Wednesday.\n\nSeparately, a federal judge in Oregon on Sunday temporarily blocked the administration from sending any troops to police Portland, the state\u2019s largest city.\n\nThe Trump administration has portrayed the cities as war-ravaged and lawless amid its escalation in immigration enforcement.\n\n\u201cThese Democrats are, like, insurrectionists, OK?\u201d the president said Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019re so bad for our country. Their policy is so bad for our country.\u201d\n\nOfficials in Illinois and Oregon, however, say military intervention isn\u2019t needed and that federal involvement is inflaming the situation.\n\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, accused Trump of intentionally trying to foment violence, which the president could then use to justify further militarisation.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is using our service members as political props and as pawns in his illegal effort to militarise our nation\u2019s cities,\u201d Pritzker said on Monday.\n\n\u201cThere is no insurrection in Portland. No threat to national security,\u201d Democratic Oregon Governor Tina Kotek has said.\n\nWhat is the Insurrection Act, and can Trump invoke it?\n\nWhen speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump made it clear that he\u2019s considering invoking the Insurrection Act to clear the way for him to send soldiers to US cities.\n\n\u201cWe have an Insurrection Act for a reason. If I had to enact it, I\u2019d do that,\u201d Trump said on Monday.\n\nThe federal law dates back to 1807 and gives the US president the power to deploy the military or federalise National Guard troops anywhere in the US to restore order during an insurrection.\n\nConstitutional lawyer Bruce Fein told Al Jazeera that presidential powers under the act apply only in cases of major rebellion, equivalent to the US Civil War, where normal law enforcement and courts can\u2019t function. However, Fein added that it is unclear whether a president\u2019s declaration of insurrection can be challenged in court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCongress, however, could impeach and remove Trump for misuse of the act in Portland,\u201d Fein said, adding that military law obligates personnel to disobey orders that are clearly unlawful.\n\nHe said Trump\u2019s use of the act in Portland would be \u201cclearly illegal\u201d even if it cannot be challenged in court.\n\nThe Insurrection Act has been invoked in response to 30 incidents, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nThe last time it was invoked was in 1992, in response to riots in Los Angeles by Republican President George HW Bush.", "authors": [], "published_date": "2025-10-07T00:00:00", "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25280665815461-1759868765.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440", "summary": "National Guard troops from Texas have arrived in the US state of Illinois, ahead of a planned deployment to Chicago that is strongly opposed by local officials.\nTrump has also ordered Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, following earlier deployments to Los Angeles and Washington, DC.\nIllinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration on Monday, seeking to block orders to federalise 300 Illinois Guard troops and send Texas Guard troops to Chicago.\nDuring a hearing, US Justice Department lawyers told a federal judge that Texas Guard troops were already in transit to Illinois.\nThe Trump administration has portrayed the cities as war-ravaged and lawless amid its escalation in immigration enforcement.", "keywords": ["national", "chicago", "crackdown", "president", "illinois", "trump", "arrive", "troops", "act", "insurrection", "administration", "escalates", "federal", "guard", "portland"], "success": true, "error": null}}
