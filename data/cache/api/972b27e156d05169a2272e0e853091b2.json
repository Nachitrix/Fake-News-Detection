This brings the total deported so far up to 341.\n\nThe Greek Foreign Ministry confirmed that 161 of the expelled activists \u2014 including 27 Greeks and 134 nationals from 15 other countries \u2014 arrived on a flight to Athens on Monday, according to news agency AFP.\n\n\u201cLet me be very clear. There is a genocide going on,\u201d Thunberg told the crowd at the Athens airport, referring to Israeli military action in Gaza.\n\n\u201cOur international systems are betraying Palestinians. They are not even able to prevent the worst war crimes from happening,\u201d she said, in comments carried by AFP.\n\n\u201cWhat we aimed to do with the Global Sumud Flotilla was to step up when our governments failed to do their legal obligation,\u201d she added.\n\nThe 22-year-old was allegedly abused by Israeli forces while in detention. Turkish journalist and Sumud Flotilla participant Ersin Celik earlier told local media how Thunberg was \u201cdragged on the ground\u201d and \u201cforced to kiss the Israeli flag\u201d.\n\nSlovakia\u2019s Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, confirmed that 10 of the deportees had arrived there, including one of its nationals and nine other people from the Netherlands, Canada and the United States.\n\n\u2018Long live the flotilla\u2019\n\nCrowds of demonstrators welcomed the activists, unfurling a huge Palestinian flag in the arrivals hall and chanting: \u201cFreedom for Palestine\u201d and \u201cLong live the flotilla!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong those arriving in Athens, Rima Hassan, a French-Palestinian member of the European Parliament, reported having been hit by Israeli police after the flotilla was intercepted.\n\n\u201cI was beaten by two police officers when they put me in the van,\u201d she told AFP.\n\nHassan said she and other detainees were kept in groups of up to 15 per cell on mattresses in a high-security Israeli prison.\n\nThe flotilla departed from Barcelona in Spain in early September and was intercepted by the Israeli navy in international waters approaching Gaza.\n\nIsraeli police said more than 470 people aboard the flotilla boats were arrested. The Foreign Ministry told AFP that 138 flotilla participants remained in detention in Israel.", "authors": [], "published_date": "2025-10-06T00:00:00", "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-06T170710Z_1741660141_RC2H6HATLK4B_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-FLOTILLA-GREECE-1759775678.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440", "summary": "Swedish activist Greta Thunberg has arrived in Greece along with 160 other campaigners from the Global Sumud Flotilla, having been deported by Israel.\nThere is a genocide going on,\u201d Thunberg told the crowd at the Athens airport, referring to Israeli military action in Gaza.\n\u201cWhat we aimed to do with the Global Sumud Flotilla was to step up when our governments failed to do their legal obligation,\u201d she added.\nTurkish journalist and Sumud Flotilla participant Ersin Celik earlier told local media how Thunberg was \u201cdragged on the ground\u201d and \u201cforced to kiss the Israeli flag\u201d.\nThe Foreign Ministry told AFP that 138 flotilla participants remained in detention in Israel.", "keywords": ["israel", "told", "thunberg", "gaza", "greta", "ministry", "flotilla", "foreign", "arrived", "deports", "israeli", "athens", "sumud", "activists"], "success": true, "error": null}}
