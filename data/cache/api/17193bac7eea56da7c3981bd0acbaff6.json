This alarming trend threatens vulnerable rural communities, already grappling with high snakebite fatalities and limited healthcare access. Researchers warn that species like the common krait and Russell's viper could spread north, necessitating urgent improvements in medical infrastructure and antivenom availability to mitigate this growing crisis.\n\nClimate change has already begun altering ecosystems in ways that have not even been completely discovered to date. The temperatures are rising and weather patterns are shifting, which is also resulting in the change of the habits of many animals, with some species expanding their territories and others heading towards endangerment. India is among the countries with one of the highest snake bite fatality rates in the world, which could mean a more dangerous future. A recent study has brought to light a shocking discovery that climate change may be pushing venomous snakes beyond boundaries, threatening more communities that are already vulnerable due to limited healthcare infrastructure.\n\nSadhguru Reveals: How Venom Impacts Your Brain & Body Like Never Before\n\nThe World Health Organisation has reported that in India, 46,000-60,000 people lose their lives to venomous snakes every year. This huge number makes India the deadliest country for snake bites globally.\n\nIndian Cobra\n\nClimate change is expanding the reach of snakes\n\nResearchers are warning that climate change could push snakes into new areas, creating bigger health risks, especially in rural regions where healthcare is hard to access. The study, published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, is the first in India to connect climate models of snake movement with factors like socio-economic vulnerability and the availability of healthcare. Led by Imon Abedin from the Dibru-Saikhowa Conservation Society, the research focused on India\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d venomous snake species responsible for the majority of serious bites. The study looks at how these snakes' habitats might change over the next 50 years. The team used climate data along with health and economic information to create a \u201csnakebite risk index,\u201d predicting which areas will be most at risk. Their findings suggest that snakes like the common krait, Russell\u2019s viper, Indian cobra, and Saw-scaled viper could spread into northern and northeastern India, potentially putting more people in danger.\n\nSaw-scaled viper\n\n\u201cClimate change is altering snake species' geographic ranges, resulting in expansions, contractions, or shifting ranges,\u201d the researchers explained. \u201cSuch changes may increase human-snake interactions across rural and urban areas.\u201d\n\nWhy it makes the rural areas of India more vulnerable\n\nThis study paints a troubling picture for rural communities in India, which are already the hardest hit by snakebites. Snakebite incidents are most common in these areas, where people often work outdoors in agriculture or other high-risk environments. With healthcare services being scarce and inadequate in many of these places, the mortality rate for snakebites remains alarmingly high.\n\nRussell\u2019s Viper\n\nTo combat this emerging threat, the researchers suggest that improvements are needed in medical infrastructure, the availability of antivenoms, and access to trained healthcare personnel in rural districts. As the snakes expand into new territories, there is a need for quick response systems and better healthcare resources. The study also calls for greater investment in antivenom research to ensure that life-saving treatments are available in all at-risk areas.\n\nA growing crisis?\n\nWhile the study paints a worrying picture of what the future could hold, it also highlights some major gaps in the data that make it hard to predict exactly how these snakes will behave as the climate changes. Things like habitat loss, urbanisation, and farming practices could all affect how these snakes spread and interact with people.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media", "authors": ["Trending Desk"], "published_date": "2025-10-06T17:40:00+05:30", "top_image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124337053,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-133676,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "summary": "Climate change is pushing venomous snakes into new territories across India, a recent study reveals.\nClimate change is pushing venomous snakes into new territories across India, a recent study reveals.\nClimate change has already begun altering ecosystems in ways that have not even been completely discovered to date.\nIndian Cobra Climate change is expanding the reach of snakes Researchers are warning that climate change could push snakes into new areas, creating bigger health risks, especially in rural regions where healthcare is hard to access.\nSaw-scaled viper \u201cClimate change is altering snake species' geographic ranges, resulting in expansions, contractions, or shifting ranges,\u201d the researchers explained.", "keywords": ["indian", "dangerous", "snakes", "climate", "change", "study", "venomous", "india", "healthcare", "rural", "viper", "areas", "researchers", "species", "snake", "territories", "vulnerable", "communities", "snakebite", "access", "common", "spread", "infrastructure", "availability", "pushing", "recent", "reveals", "high", "limited", "krait", "improvements", "medical", "antivenom", "growing", "crisis"], "success": true, "error": null}}
