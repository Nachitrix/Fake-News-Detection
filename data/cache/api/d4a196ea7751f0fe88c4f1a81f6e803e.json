Governor Pritzker also!\u201d Trump posted Wednesday on his Truth Social platform.\n\nLocal officials argue that city and state law enforcement are sufficient to handle the protests, but Trump claims the military is needed to keep federal agents safe, heightening concerns among his critics of growing authoritarianism.\n\nAfter National Guard deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, DC, 200 troops arrived in Illinois on Tuesday.\n\nAn immigration enforcement building outside Chicago has also been the site of clashes between federal agents and protesters.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has not communicated with us in any way about their troop movements,\u201d Pritzker told reporters in Chicago. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have to say \u2018troop movements\u2019 in an American city, but that is what we\u2019re talking about here.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA judge will have a role in determining how many boots are on the streets: There\u2019s a court hearing Thursday on a request by Illinois and Chicago to declare the National Guard deployment illegal.\n\n\u2018Stand up and speak out\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks on Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, both Democrats, follow similar extraordinary public calls by the president for his political opponents to face legal charges.\n\nThey come on the same day that former FBI director James Comey was arraigned on charges of lying to Congress \u2013 an indictment which came just days after Trump urged his attorney general to take action against him and others.\n\nPritzker, seen as a potential Democratic candidate in the 2028 presidential election, has become one of Trump\u2019s most fiery critics.\n\nHe pledged Wednesday to \u201cnot back down,\u201d listing a litany of grievances against Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.\n\n\u201cMaking people feel they need to carry citizenship papers. Invading our state with military troops. Sending in war helicopters in the middle of the night,\u201d he wrote on X.\n\n\u201cWhat else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe must all stand up and speak out.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cwar helicopters\u201d, Pritzker was referring to a major raid last week in which Black Hawk helicopters descended on a Chicago housing complex.\n\nDozens of people were arrested in the surprise operation, according to the Trump administration, but US media reported that American citizens were detained for hours.\n\nMayor Johnson has since announced \u201cICE-free zones\u201d where city-owned property will be declared off-limits to federal authorities.\n\nJohnson accused Republicans of wanting \u201ca rematch of the Civil War\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s immigration crackdown is aimed at fulfilling a key election pledge to rid the country of what he called waves of foreign \u201ccriminals\u201d.\n\nTrump has nonetheless faced some legal setbacks, including a federal judge in Oregon blocking his bid to deploy troops in Portland, saying his descriptions of an emergency there were false and that the US is a \u201cnation of Constitutional law, not martial law\u201d.\n\nTrump says he could invoke the rarely used Insurrection Act to force deployments of troops around the country if courts or local officials are \u201cholding us up\u201d.", "authors": [], "published_date": "2025-10-08T00:00:00", "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25280665815461-1759868765.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440", "summary": "Trump slams Chicago mayor and Illinois governor resisting his mass deportation campaign as troops arrive in state.\n\u201cChicago Mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers!\nAn immigration enforcement building outside Chicago has also been the site of clashes between federal agents and protesters.\n\u201cThe federal government has not communicated with us in any way about their troop movements,\u201d Pritzker told reporters in Chicago.\n\u2018Stand up and speak out\u2019Trump\u2019s attacks on Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, both Democrats, follow similar extraordinary public calls by the president for his political opponents to face legal charges.", "keywords": ["chicago", "illinois", "immigration", "trump", "calls", "dispute", "troops", "mayor", "pritzker", "federal", "officials", "state", "governor", "jail"], "success": true, "error": null}}
