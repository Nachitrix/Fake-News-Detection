If I had to enact it, I\u2019d do that,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday.\n\n\u201cIf people were being killed and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I\u2019d do that,\u201d Trump added.\n\nThe US president\u2019s comments came shortly after US District Judge April Perry allowed the federal government to continue the deployment in Chicago while it responds to a new court case filed by the state of Illinois, challenging the deployment of National Guard soldiers to the city.\n\nPerry set a deadline of midnight Wednesday for the federal government to reply.\n\nIllinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and officials from the city of Chicago filed the lawsuit earlier on Monday, after a federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked Trump from sending the National Guard to the state\u2019s largest city, Portland, on Sunday night.\n\nTrump has sought to expand the use of the US military during his second term, including to aid in domestic immigration and law enforcement.\n\nThat has come amid a wider effort to portray Democrat-run cities as violence-ridden and lawless.\n\nIn a post on X, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker decried Trump\u2019s latest plan, which would involve federalising 300 of the state\u2019s National Guard troops and deploying another 400 from Texas, as \u201cunlawful and unconstitutional\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking later in the day, he further accused Trump of using members of the military as \u201cpolitical props\u201d, charging that the president was trying to \u201cjustify and normalise the presence of armed soldiers under his direct command\u201d.\n\nThe state\u2019s Attorney General Raoul said US citizens \u201cshould not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly for the reason that their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president\u2019s favour\u201d.\n\nSince taking office in January, Trump has already deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles in the state of California and the federal district of Washington, DC, and has floated sending troops to at least eight other major cities.\n\nIn September, a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration \u201cwilfully \u201d broke federal law by deploying guard troops to Los Angeles amid protests over immigration raids.\n\nIn the Oregon case, Judge Karin Immergut temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s plan to deploy 200 National Guard troops from neighbouring California, saying anti-immigration enforcement protests there \u201cdid not pose a danger of rebellion\u201d.\n\nImmergut also chided the Trump administration for appearing to disregard an order she had issued just a day earlier.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t defendants simply circumventing my order?\u201d she asked on Sunday. \u201cWhy is this appropriate?\u201d\n\nUnder US law, the US military cannot be used for domestic law enforcement unless the president deems the situation an insurrection and invokes the Insurrection Act. However, the National Guard can be used in a support capacity for federal law enforcement agents in some instances.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he was open to invoking the federal law, which dates back to 1807.\n\nDespite the legal setbacks, the US president has remained defiant.\n\nSpeaking to US military commanders last week, Trump referred to \u201ccivil disturbances\u201d as the \u201cenemy within\u201d. He further pledged to straighten out US cities \u201cone by one\u201d.\n\nIn one particularly remarkable statement, Trump said: \u201cWe should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.\u201d\n\nBeyond the National Guard, the Trump administration has surged federal law enforcement and immigration agents to cities across the country.\n\nIn Chicago, protesters have frequently rallied near an immigration facility outside of the city, where authorities arrested 13 people on Friday.\n\nOn Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said federal agents shot a woman in Chicago\u2019s southwest.\n\nA department statement said the shooting happened after Border Patrol agents monitoring the area \u201cwere rammed by vehicles and boxed in by 10 cars\u201d. The woman, who survived the shooting, was taken into federal custody soon afterwards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn another incident last week, federal agents \u201crappelled from Black Hawk helicopters\u201d as they stormed a five-storey apartment building, according to a report in US cable news network NewsNation, which was invited to observe the operation.", "authors": [], "published_date": "2025-10-06T00:00:00", "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reuters_68e3ea42-1759767106.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440", "summary": "US president's comments came as Portland, Chicago continue to fight the deployment of the national guard in the courts.\nIn September, a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration \u201cwilfully \u201d broke federal law by deploying guard troops to Los Angeles amid protests over immigration raids.\nIn the Oregon case, Judge Karin Immergut temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s plan to deploy 200 National Guard troops from neighbouring California, saying anti-immigration enforcement protests there \u201cdid not pose a danger of rebellion\u201d.\nHowever, the National Guard can be used in a support capacity for federal law enforcement agents in some instances.\nOn Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said federal agents shot a woman in Chicago\u2019s southwest.", "keywords": ["agents", "national", "threatens", "states", "cities", "trump", "law", "troops", "act", "insurrection", "federal", "deploy", "guard", "military"], "success": true, "error": null}}
